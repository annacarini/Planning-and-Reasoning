# Planning & Reasoning - Project

## Domain

## Tests

We generated five instances of problems, and we tested them using three different heuristics.<br/>
In particular, we used:
- **A\*** (without reopening) search algorithm with the **hmax** heuristic
- **A\*** (without reopening) search algorithm with the **ff** heuristic
- **Greedy** (without reopening) search algorithm with the **ff** heuristic
- **A\*** (with reopening) search algorithm with the **lmcut** heuristic

#### Generating the problems

The instances have been generated using the script [problemGenerator.py](Script_python/problemGenerator.py), that uses the class *Problem* defined inside [Problem.py](Script_python/Problem.py).<br/>

Usage:<br/>
  
    cd Planning-and-Reasoning/
    python Script_python/problemGenerator.py

#### Drawing the plans

The plans obtained have then been drawn using the script [planDrawer.py](Script_python/planDrawer.py).<br/>
In order to draw the plans, a folder with the same name of the problem must exist inside "Script_python/", and it must contain:
- the file *\<problem name\>.txt* generated by the problem generator
- the plan file generated by Fast Downward

Usage:<br/>
  
    cd Planning-and-Reasoning/
    python Script_python/planDrawer.py <name of the problem> <name of the plan file>
